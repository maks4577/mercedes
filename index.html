    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>The W222 is the first S-Class using very-high-speed FlexRay optical fiber data bus technology, which interconnects (data fusion) all electrical/electronic systems, particularly the comand online control interface (with Intel Atom processor), MBC road scanning  and the multitude of new driver assistance systems, since all these require very high data bit rates.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Suspension</h2>
    <p>Mercedes' Active Body Control hydraulic active suspension has been updated with a system dubbed Magic Body Control (MBC) that is fitted with a road-sensing system ("Road surface scan") that pre-scans the road for uneven surfaces, potholes and bumps. 
    Using a stereo camera, the system scans the road surface up to 15 meters ahead of the vehicle at speeds up to 130 km/h (81 mph), and it adjusts the shock damping at each wheel to account for imperfections in the road. 
    Magic Body Control is not available on any of the 4-Matic models, as of Model Year 2017. </p>
